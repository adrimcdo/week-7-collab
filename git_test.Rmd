Hi James!
Hi Adriane!

This is much easier than I thought it would be haha :)

It is! I really like the ease of collaboration with R. I primarily used Matlab before, but I think this class has converted me to R lol

I didn't know what to do next so I fixed the typo and I guess I'll just push again.

Adding one more line.

Adding another line.

Added one more change in case you want to test :)
